# Reflection on the Use of GenAI

Initially, I didn’t realize that there was a full step-by-step lab guide available. I mistakenly assumed that the slides were the only resource and that I had to figure out the entire lab process on my own. As a result, I proceeded to complete the lab manually, skipping the generated files. Despite everything being built, deployed, and rendered, the website still didn’t display the output as expected. Feeling stuck, I approached the professor's lab for help, but upon reflection, I realized that I had missed a critical step. I needed to redo the entire lab from the beginning, using the provided instructions. This oversight caused me to submit the assignment later than intended. While the experience was frustrating, it taught me the importance of fully reviewing available resources and instructions before diving into tasks. It also highlighted how small mistakes can lead to bigger delays in the learning process.
